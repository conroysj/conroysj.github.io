Thankfully, the talk, our experience, and studies had informed us well: after some short deliberation, we decided to use PostgreSQL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="relationaldatabases"&gt;Relational Databases&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL (aka databases which use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"&gt;structured query language&lt;/a&gt;) use binary code to store information. This allows for speedy lookup times, in addition to efficient queries that can compare different, but relational datasets. There are some limitations: namely, the structure of your dataset is less maleable after it's created. Also, entries are space-limited by a pre-defined integer/character restriction-specification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An SQL database made most sense for our project because we wanted to be able to make comparative queries on the fly. One of the features of our project allows users to create groups with other users, and to share particular information with particular groups, somewhat like circles in Google+. Rendering these groups and relevant information involves creating join tables between the users and group tables, as well as between the table containing users' information points and their relevant groups. While possible using another type of database, this would have proved costly in time and space requirements - especially so given large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="nonrelationaldatabases"&gt;Non-relational Databases&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative databases we considered included non-relational databases, like Firebase. These allow for the quick storing of data and a quick lookup of information, but only when particular to one data store, like all of the information points on one user. JSON data stores used in these databases store data in no particular order, but the manner by which the data is structured (ie the parameters, the amount of data etc.) may be iterated on as desired. Unlike relational databases, they are not restricted by a pre-defined integer/character specification and count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating through each user's JSON store in order to find them party to a particular group, or through a group's JSON store in order to find users, is time consuming. This would have been the case with finding users' information points and their relevant groups in our project. Storing information in key : value pairs is a great, speedy way of storing data, however. It must also be said that setting up a database on Firebase is a breeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="morefantasticoptions"&gt;More Fantastic Options&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We considered other databases, all of which have their own unique set of advantages and disadvantages - each of which worthy of their own blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few takeaways from Laurie's talk that helped me consider these databases include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memcache: Good for ephemeral data (though cache can always be pulled out again). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redis: Stores to disk constantly vs at every x interval. Great for a persistent, comprehensive back up system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB: Great for prototypes. Like other non-relational databases: sort of schemaless, hard to scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CouchDB: Great for replication..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LevelDB: Great for storing key : value pairs, easy to install. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL: Defacto leader of relational databases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle: More $, fewer problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cassandra: Great for: high write and low read, like ad network stats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riak: Cassandra competitor, easily scaled. Can trade off read/write speed, partition tolerance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neo4J: Application specific database, great for graphs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The File System: Durable! Good replication, has been super slow, but now we have SSDs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HDFS/HBase - hadoop: Big data.. woo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S3: Durable, scaleable, and possibly pricey? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering why we can't just have it all? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem"&gt;Start here.&lt;/a&gt; If you think you've got a workaround that might allow you to design the ultimate database that has it all, get in touch! &lt;/p&gt;

They're not the kind of issues that might convince you to leave it in reckless abandon, though they might eat into your lunch hour (like they did to my own :o ).. unless, that is, you've encountered the following issue and you're reading this blog! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was building a view in an application that required a user interface with form validation: I wanted to allow users to submit information, but only particular information (the right information, character limits, etc.) accompanied by an image. Angular makes it super simple to carry out form validation. After reviewing a mighty &lt;a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-form-validation"&gt;tutorial on scotch.io&lt;/a&gt;, I took to my text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the form, two-way data binding worked great on all of the text inputs/textarea, but not so well on the file input - where images were to be attached for uploading. A cursory search revealed that others had the &lt;a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1375"&gt;same&lt;/a&gt; issue. I tried a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16207202/required-attribute-not-working-with-file-input-in-angular-js"&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt; that would detect when a file was uploaded and therefore validate the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.directive('validFile', function () {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    link: function (scope, el, attrs, ngModel) {
      ngModel.$render = function () {
        ngModel.$setViewValue(el.val());
      };
      el.bind('change', function () {
        scope.$apply(function () {
          ngModel.$render();
        });
      });
    }
  };
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but the same directive did not actually succeed in uploading that file: The back-end's attempt to parse the post request's data returned evidence of the void: cannot read ~ of undefined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was to patch in a bit of jQuery, which worked swimmingly. In the controller, we created a new FormData object and appended the necessary information to it, substituting a jQuery selector for the item that we couldn't bind via angular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
fd.append('file', $('.image')[0].files[0], 'image');
fd.append('dish_name', $scope.dishname);
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to both validate the form using the above directive and ensure that it was being appended to the FormData.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Upload Image:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="file" name="image" class="image" ng-model="file" valid-file required accept="image/*"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/input&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{ reviewForm.image.$error.required &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ' - please upload an image file - ' || 'Looks good!'}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Dish Name:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;textarea class="review-dishname" name="dishname" ng-model="dishname" ng-minlength="2" ng-required="true"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p ng-show="reviewForm.dishname.$error.required &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !reviewForm.dishname.$pristine" class="help-block"&amp;gt;Please enter the name of the dish you're reviewing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular leverages jQuery to meet different ends, and I'm not sure why it doesn't do so in this instance. But I'm sure that it will be a likely new feature/patch come Angular 2.0 - due any month now. It makes perfect sense that the ng-model service should work for 'input type=file' and therefore permit two-way data binding, so that users can upload content seamlessly, and, for example, be made aware in real-time that their content has been uploaded. &lt;/p&gt;
